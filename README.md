Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive and data-driven dashboard using Power BI, designed to provide detailed insights into credit card transactions and customer activities. The dashboard is structured into two main pages, each featuring various charts and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to facilitate comprehensive reporting and analysis.

Pages
1. Card Transaction Report
The Card Transaction Report page delivers a thorough analysis of all credit card transactions.

2. Credit Card Customer Report
The Credit Card Customer Report page focuses on the profile and behavior of credit card customers. Key features include:
Customer Profiles: Comprehensive profiles with personal information, credit score, and account status displayed in an easy-to-read format.

Usage Patterns: Interactive charts showing credit card usage trends, payment history, and credit limits.

Customer Segmentation: Analytical tools and visualizations to segment customers based on spending habits, demographics, and creditworthiness.

Technologies Used
Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards, with robust data visualization capabilities.

Data Sources: Integrated various data sources, including SQL databases, Excel files, and online services, to ensure accurate and up-to-date reporting.

DAX: Leveraged Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for creating calculated columns and measures to enhance the analytical depth of the reports.

Impact
This Power BI dashboard empowers financial institutions to gain valuable insights into credit card usage and customer behavior, aiding in strategic decision-making and improving customer service. The dashboard's advanced analytics and visualization capabilities also help in identifying potential fraudulent activities, thereby enhancing security measures.
